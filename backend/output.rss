    <title>Book Review: The Air We Breathe - Glen Scrivener</title>
    <description>Glen Scrivener has written The Air We Breathe - How We All Came to Believe in Freedom, Kindness, Progress, and Equality. Engaging with history and contemporary thinkers he proposes that the influence of the Christian gospel is behind massive contributions that have established and stabilised the world as we know it. However, while his claims are encouraging and stimulating to the Christian believer they are typically unknown and unconsidered by the majority of people. 
Kenneth Brownell and Ben Virgo discussed the book in the most recent episode of the Christian Heritage London podcast. </description>

    <title>Ian Galloway interview</title>
    <description>Ian Galloway studied Medicine at Newcastle and started following Jesus in his first year, "after discovering that the resurrection was true, Jesus was alive and was inviting Ian to be his friend." Ian and his wife Heather started a new church in Byker with four friends. This became what is now City Church. Ian served as lead pastor for thirty-three years and an influential church grew. He now teaches at the University of Durham where he is Director Of The Free Church Track, and has lately written Called to be Friends (Hodder and Stoughton) on John's gospel.</description>

    <title>Bill Edgar interview: A Supreme Love</title>
    <description>Bill Edgar, who we have previously interviewed on the Christian Heritage London podcast, taught Apologetics at Westminster Theological Seminary from 1989 until summer 2022, and has now written a book on a subject dear to his heart: jazz. In A Supreme Love, Edgar considers the context from which this unique art form came in American history, the pioneers who defined it and the transcendent nature of its beauty. It's a fascinating introduction to, and commentary on, a musical genre which, he argues, can only be appreciated in light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We had an excellent time talking with him about it on the Christian Heritage London podcast.</description>

    <description>Allen McClymont is a typical Londoner: born in Malaysia he grew up in New Zealand and has taught New Testament Greek in Malaysia! For nearly twenty years he's worked with OMF, the missionary society begun by J Hudson Taylor.

    <title>Chris Larson interview</title>
    <description>Chris Larson is President and CEO of Ligonier Ministries, which began as the ministry of R C Sproul. R C's ministry has established and inspired believers internationally for generations - his great book The Holiness of God being a watershed text for many.  Ligonier established a number of teaching fellowships such as Sinclair Ferguson and Stephen Nichols, and has continued to serve the church internationally through resources and conferences. Thus following R C's death in 2017 Ligonier has continued, under the leadership of Chris Larson, to be a potent and strategic asset in the worldwide church. We had a superb day with Chris lately walking through London's church history and talking with him about heroes, strategy and effectiveness on the podcast.</description>

    <title>Iain Murray interview</title>
    <description>While he was assistant to Dr Martyn Lloyd-Jones at Westminster Chapel in London, Iain Murray was asked by the Doctor to give some lectures on church history. And so began a fascination with church history which would flourish into a ministry which would bless the body of Christ internationally: the Banner of Truth publishing house. If you have heard of Charles Spurgeon, Jonathan Edwards, John Owen, J C Ryle, Richard Sibbes or any of the English Puritans it is likely because of the Banner of Truth. The Banner of Truth has reprinted their works for decades, as well as the works of Dr Lloyd-Jones, Sinclair Ferguson and other contemporary writers. Iain Murray himself has written many highly acclaimed biographies, including works on Jonathan Edwards, Charles Spurgeon and John Wesley, as well as the authorised biography of Dr Martyn Lloyd-Jones himself. It was a great privilege to sit down with Iain, to hear his story, and to talk about people who've inspired him.</description>

    <title>Alun Ebenezer interview</title>
    <description>Alun Ebenezer is the founding headmaster of Fulham Boys School, a centre of excellence in central London. Here boys are taught from an ethos of resilience, kindness and a can do attitude - an ethos that is geared towards boys, which nurtures enterprise - business, social and personal - and is built upon the Christian Faith. It's an ethos which relies on strong leadership, is committed to firm discipline, academic excellence, a love of sport and an appreciation of the arts. It was a privilege to talk with Alun, a leader in our time, about his own story of putting his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, his own heroes and the story of a remarkable work of faith in central London in our time.</description>

    <title>Sharon James book launch</title>
    <description>Sharon James studied history at Cambridge and theology in Toronto and Wales, and now brings piercing, prophetic insight to the extraordinary challenges of our culture through her work at The Christian Institute.  Sharon has lately written The Lies We Are Told, The Truth We Must Hold, in which she looks at the thought behind the cultural challenges of our moment and how they are answered in the gospel.  Conrad Mbewe said of the book “The panoramic view is breath-taking! It is like standing on the sun and seeing all the planets in the solar system going around in beautiful symmetry. The confusion turns to picturesque order.”  Wayne Grudem called it “a remarkable book”.</description>

    <title>Andrew Sach and Jonathan Gemmell book launch - Are You 100% Sure You Want To Be An Agnostic?</title>
    <description>You’re not sure what you think about God. You’re not an atheist – you’re not that confident of his non-existence. You’re not a Christian or a Muslim, though you’ve got nothing against either of them. You prefer to identify as a humble agnostic.  Some would say you’re sitting on the fence, but why not? It’s a comfortable enough place to be. Why can’t we all just admit we don’t know? Yet sometimes you do have questions. Where did we come from? What happens when we die? Can anyone make sense of all the suffering in the world? What’s it all for? You wouldn’t mind answers to some of them, as long as no one tried to brainwash you. You’re not 100% sure that you enjoy not being sure.</description>
